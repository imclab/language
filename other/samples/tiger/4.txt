The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies. Its populations have been estimated at 1,706–1,909 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 124–229 in Nepal and 67–81 in Bhutan. Since 2010, it has been classified as an endangered species by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend, and none of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals.

Bengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomial Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomial Panthera tigris tigris.

It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.
